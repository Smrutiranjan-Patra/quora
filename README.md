This is the clone of [Quora](https://www.https://www.quora.com) build using MERN Stack. We started this project as a five member team during the fifth unit construct week organised at Masai School, Bengaluru, Karnataka. 


The website resembles a real clone and you can login using google authentication or can create new account. You can ask question here.


## How to run the app

To run this application, you have to set your own environmental variables. For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the application:

* MONGO_URI: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.
* JWT_ACCESS_KEY: This is a key which is used to authencticate user. You can put any strings here.
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: These credentials can be created using Google cloud platform. This helps to authenticate a user using Google OAuth.4

After you've set these environmental variables in the .env file at the root of the project, you need to fill your empty MongoDB Atlas database by creating new products in the Products collection.

Now you can run "npm start" in the terminal and the application should work.
